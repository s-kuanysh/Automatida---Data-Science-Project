# Automatida Project

## Project Overview
Automatida, a fictional data consulting firm, was hired by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (NYC TLC) to analyze and develop data-driven solutions based on New York City taxi trip data. This project involves analyzing, modeling, and extracting insights from the taxi trip dataset to understand patterns and make informed decisions.

## Project Objectives
- **Data Exploration**: Perform a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the NYC taxi trip data to uncover trends, correlations, and potential issues.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data for machine learning, including handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implement various machine learning models to predict specific outcomes, such as trip duration or fare amount.
- **Insight Extraction**: Identify key factors influencing taxi trips to provide actionable insights for decision-making.

## Project Workflow
### 1. **Data Loading and Initial Inspection**
   - **Task**: Load the NYC taxi trip data and inspect its structure.
   - **Method**: The dataset was imported using Pandas and the first few rows were displayed to understand the features.
   - **Outcome**: The dataset contains columns related to trip details, such as pickup/drop-off locations, trip duration, fare amount, passenger count, etc.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Task**: Explore the dataset to identify trends, correlations, and potential issues like outliers or missing values.
   - **Method**:
     - **Visualizations**: Used histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to analyze distributions and relationships among variables.
     - **Statistical Analysis**: Computed summary statistics to understand the central tendencies, variability, and correlations between features.
   - **Outcome**: 
     - Identified key trends, such as peak times for taxi usage, fare distribution, and common routes.
     - Detected outliers in trip durations and fare amounts, which may need further handling during preprocessing.

### 3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Task**: Clean and transform the data to prepare it for modeling.
   - **Method**:
     - **Handling Missing Values**: Addressed missing data points by either imputing values or removing rows with insufficient information.
     - **Feature Engineering**: Extracted new features from the existing data (e.g., trip duration from pickup and drop-off times).
     - **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Converted categorical data (e.g., pickup location IDs) into numerical format using One-Hot Encoding.
     - **Scaling**: Standardized numerical features to ensure they are on the same scale using `StandardScaler`.
   - **Outcome**: Produced a cleaned and transformed dataset ready for machine learning, with relevant features extracted for modeling.

### 4. **Predictive Modeling**
   - **Task**: Train machine learning models to predict outcomes such as trip duration or fare amount.
   - **Method**:
     - **Logistic Regression & Linear Regression**: Implemented for initial modeling of binary and continuous outcomes.
     - **Random Forest Classifier**: Used to model complex relationships between trip characteristics and outcomes, providing feature importance insights.
     - **XGBoost Classifier**: Applied gradient boosting for enhanced predictive accuracy.
     - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilized Grid Search (`GridSearchCV`) to optimize model parameters.
   - **Outcome**: Developed predictive models to forecast key taxi trip metrics, allowing for comparisons of model performance and accuracy.

### 5. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Task**: Assess the performance of the predictive models.
   - **Method**:
     - **Confusion Matrix**: For classification tasks, evaluated model performance in terms of true positives, false positives, etc.
     - **Evaluation Metrics**: Calculated accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification tasks, and mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and RÂ² for regression tasks.
     - **ROC-AUC Score**: Used to evaluate the discriminative ability of the models.
   - **Outcome**: 
     - Identified the best-performing model based on the chosen metrics.
     - Provided a comprehensive evaluation of model strengths and limitations.

### 6. **Insight Extraction**
   - **Task**: Analyze model outputs and feature importance to derive actionable insights.
   - **Method**:
     - **Feature Importance**: Visualized and interpreted feature importance scores to identify key factors influencing trip outcomes.
     - **Pattern Recognition**: Analyzed identified patterns to provide recommendations for taxi fleet management and customer service improvements.
   - **Outcome**: 
     - Highlighted critical variables affecting taxi trip duration and fare, such as pickup/drop-off locations, time of day, and traffic conditions.
     - Suggested strategies for optimizing taxi operations based on data-driven findings.

## Key Findings
- **Trip Patterns**: Identified peak hours for taxi usage, common routes, and factors contributing to longer trip durations.
- **Model Performance**: Advanced models like Random Forest and XGBoost provided higher accuracy in predicting trip outcomes compared to simpler models.
- **Feature Insights**: Important features influencing taxi trips included trip distance, pickup/drop-off location, and time of day, suggesting potential areas for operational improvements.
